/*
### Design an Employee class with three attributes: name, age, and salary. Implement a method
    updateSalary(Employee emp, double newSalary) that takes an Employee object and a new salary
    as parameters, updating the employeeâ€™s salary accordingly. Additionally, create a
    method printDetails(Employee emp) that accepts an Employee object and prints its details.
